## Description
-The employee database handler handles an sql database for small businesses. This program gives you the ability to add roles, departments, and managers to employees and view each of your database tables(employees, roles, and departments) all from your terminal with an easy arrow key and typing based interface!

### Project Motivation:
- I wanted to create something that would allow any business owner to easily store information about staffing in a simple, inexpensive, and easy to run application. I like that this application is easily manipulated and scaled to fit exactly an employers needs.

### Project Problem solved:
- This project makes keeping track of staffing, pay, and roles a breeze! Gone are the days of file cabinets when you can store all needed info in a simple sql database

### Skills Learned during project:
- I learned how to use sql syntax, I improved my database skills, and widened my knowlege on what is possible with an sql database
